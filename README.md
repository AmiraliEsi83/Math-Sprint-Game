# Math-Sprint-Game
Fun filled environment for a fun round of math games.
This project is created based on Udemy's JavaScript Web Projects: ZTM Academy. It's my way of building up my JavaScript skills. The way I work on these projects are like this. I get the general information in the introduction, and the gist of how the project should look . Then I go and create my version of it stylistically just because I like to challenge myself and stand out. When I am done with HTML/SCSS I move on to JavaScript and think through the process of how I would implement it. I give myself a fair go before I run into some places where I need extra help. Then I jump through the material to the point where I feel I can understand what was done, and then go and implement it myself. Depending on my knowledge I might need to do it a couple of times, otherwise, I am most happy when I make it work with the least help from the tutorial.
